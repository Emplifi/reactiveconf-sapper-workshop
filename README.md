# Build a Website on a Headless CMS with Svelte

> It is not cool to have a WordPress template full of jQuery animations anymore. We can do way better and we all know it. But creating client side app in React for a web presentation will introduce its own set of problems. We will show you how you to create a presentation based on a headless CMS with Svelte and Sapper, a universal JavaScript framework with server-side rendering and very low runtime overhead.

Working repository for ReactiveConf 2019 workshop. Our goal is to build a website for fictional café with [Svelte][svelte], [Sapper][sapper], and [Prismic][prismic] as headless CMS. The result can be deployed to [ZEIT][zeit].

## Prerequisites

- Node 10+
